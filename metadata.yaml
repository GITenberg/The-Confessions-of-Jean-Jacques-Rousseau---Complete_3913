description: When it was first published in 1781, The Confessions scandalised Europe
  with its emotional honesty and frank treatment of the author's sexual and intellectual
  development. Since then, it has had a more profound impact on European thought.
  Rousseau left posterity a model of the reflective life - the solitary, uncompromising
  individual, the enemy of servitude and habit and the selfish egoist who dedicates
  his life to a particular ideal. The Confessions recreates the world in which he
  progressed from incompetent engraver to grand success; his enthusiasm for experience,
  his love of nat.
